# Resource: aws_rds_reserved_instance

Performing a `destroy` or removing this resource from your code will only remove the resource from state.** For more information see the official [RDS Reserved Instances Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/reserved-instances/)

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "aws_rds_reserved_instance_offering" "test" {
  db_instance_class   = "db.t2.micro"
  duration            = 31536000
  multi_az            = false
  offering_type       = "All Upfront"
  product_description = "mysql"
}

resource "aws_rds_reserved_instance" "example" {
  offering_id    = data.aws_rds_reserved_instance_offering.test.offering_id
  reservation_id = "optionalCustomReservationID"
  instance_count = 3
}
```
