TIP: A few guiding principles for writing documentation:
1. Use simple language while avoiding jargon and figures of speech.
2. Focus on brevity and clarity to keep a reader's attention.
3. Use active voice and present tense whenever you can.
4. Document your feature as it exists now; do not mention the future or past if you can help it.
5. Use accessible and inclusive language.
