```hcl
resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_ec2_tag" "example" {
  resource_id = "${aws_vpc.example.id}"
  key         = "Name"
  value       = "Hello World"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `resource_id` - (Required) The ID of the EC2 resource to manage the tag for.
* `key` - (Required) The tag name.
* `value` - (Required) The value of the tag.
