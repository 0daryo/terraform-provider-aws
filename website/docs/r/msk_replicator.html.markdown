TIP: A few guiding principles for writing documentation:
1. Use simple language while avoiding jargon and figures of speech.
2. Focus on brevity and clarity to keep a reader's attention.
3. Use active voice and present tense whenever you can.
4. Document your feature as it exists now; do not mention the future or past if you can help it.
5. Use accessible and inclusive language.

# Resource: aws_kafka_replicator

Terraform resource for managing an AWS Managed Streaming for Kafka Replicator.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_msk_replicator" "test" {
  replicator_name            = "test-name"
  description                = "test-description"
  service_execution_role_arn = aws_iam_role.source.arn

  kafka_clusters {
    amazon_msk_cluster {
      msk_cluster_arn = aws_msk_cluster.source.arn
    }

    vpc_config {
      subnet_ids          = aws_subnet.source[*].id
      security_groups_ids = [aws_security_group.source.id]
    }
  }

  kafka_clusters {
    amazon_msk_cluster {
      msk_cluster_arn = aws_msk_cluster.target.arn
    }

    vpc_config {
      subnet_ids          = aws_subnet.target[*].id
      security_groups_ids = [aws_security_group.target.id]
    }
  }

  replication_info_list {
    source_kafka_cluster_arn = aws_msk_cluster.source.arn
    target_kafka_cluster_arn = aws_msk_cluster.target.arn
    target_compression_type  = "NONE"


    topic_replication {
      topics_to_replicate = [".*"]
    }

    consumer_group_replication {
      consumer_groups_to_replicate = [".*"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `example_arg` - (Required) Concise argument description. Do not begin the description with "An", "The", "Defines", "Indicates", or "Specifies," as these are verbose. In other words, "Indicates the amount of storage," can be rewritten as "Amount of storage," without losing any information.

The following arguments are optional:

* `optional_arg` - (Optional) Concise argument description. Do not begin the description with "An", "The", "Defines", "Indicates", or "Specifies," as these are verbose. In other words, "Indicates the amount of storage," can be rewritten as "Amount of storage," without losing any information.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - ARN of the Replicator. Do not begin the description with "An", "The", "Defines", "Indicates", or "Specifies," as these are verbose. In other words, "Indicates the amount of storage," can be rewritten as "Amount of storage," without losing any information.
* `example_attribute` - Concise description. Do not begin the description with "An", "The", "Defines", "Indicates", or "Specifies," as these are verbose. In other words, "Indicates the amount of storage," can be rewritten as "Amount of storage," without losing any information.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `60m`)
* `update` - (Default `180m`)
* `delete` - (Default `90m`)

## Import

Managed Streaming for Kafka Replicator can be imported using the `example_id_arg`, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_kafka_replicator.example rft-8012925589
```
