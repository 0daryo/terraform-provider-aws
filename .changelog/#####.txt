```release-note:enhancement
resource/aws_kinesis_stream: Add plan-time validation that `shard_count` does not exceed the AWS account's [shard quota](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html) when the data stream capacity mode is `PROVISIONED`. This change requires the `kinesis:DescribeLimits` IAM permission
